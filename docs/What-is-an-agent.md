What is an agent?
==============

An agent is a simple software program - requiring no installation - which connects to CALDERA in order to get instructions. It then executes the instructions and sends the results back.

CALDERA includes a plugin, [Sandcat](Plugins-sandcat.md) (54ndc47), which is our default agent.
