What is a group?
=============

A group is a collection of [agents](What-is-an-agent.md) connected to CALDERA. A group allows you to start an operation against multiple computers at the same time instead of one at a time.

When an agent is started, it automatically joins a generic group, my_group, but you can add or remove custom groups once an agent is connected. 

During an operation, if an agent laterally moves to another computer, it will automatically become associated with the same group as the agent which started it.
