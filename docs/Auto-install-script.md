Auto install script
==============

If you would like to install CALDERA quickly using our recommended approach, you should use the auto-installer.sh script, found at the root of the project. This script can be run on MacOS, Ubuntu and CentOS computers:
```
./auto-installer.sh --darwin
./auto-installer.sh --centos
./auto-installer.sh --ubuntu
```

This installer will additionally install:

## A Python virtual environment

A new virtualenv for Python will be created at the root of the project, called calderaenv. All PIP requirements will be installed here instead of the host machine directly.

## GoLang

This is used to dynamically compile the 54ndc47 agent every time it is requested, giving it a new file hash each time. If GoLang is not installed on the server, the agent will be downloaded from the sandcat/payloads directory and will not be dynamically compiled.
> If GoLang is installed, you can dynamically compile any Go payload per request by simply utilizing the file_svc:compile_go function. You'll see examples of this in the sandcat and terminal plugins.

## MinGW
MinGW enables gcc compiling support for windows platforms. CALDERA uses MinGW to build C-Shared library (DLLs) versions of Sandcat.
