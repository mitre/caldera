Plugin: caltack
============

The caltack plugin adds the public MITRE ATT&CK website to CALDERA. This is useful for deployments of CALDERA where an operator cannot access the Internet to reference the MITRE ATT&CK matrix.

After loading this plugin and restarting, the ATT&CK website is available from the CALDERA home page. Not all parts of the ATT&CK website will be available - but we aim to keep those pertaining to tactics and techniques accessible.
