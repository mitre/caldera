How to Build Agents
================

Building your own agent is a way to create a unique - or non-detectable - footprint on compromised machines. Our
default agent, 54ndc47, is a full representation of what an agent can do. This agent is written in GoLang and offers
an extensible collection of command-and-control (C2) protocols, such as communicating over HTTP or GitHub Gist. You can
extend 54ndc47 by adding your own C2 protocols in place or you can follow this guide to create your own agent 
from scratch.

## Types of agents

There are 2 unique types of agents. Determining which one you want is your first step:

1) Active - a direct communication between agent-and-server. HTTP communication is an example.
2) Passive - an indirect communication between agent-and-server. Using a trusted 3rd party, like GitHub Gists, 
is an example. 

## Understanding the layers

No matter which type of agent you write, think about it as creating layers.

### Layer 1: Beacon

The beacon layer is where the agent sends a beacon to the server, asking for instructions. The agent should then
loop through the instructions list and execute each one, sending the results back to the server.

### Layer 2: Payload

The payload layer builds on the prior layer by actuating on the payload property that is included in each instruction. 
Instructions can optionally include a payload, which instructions the agent to download the given binary before
executing the command. Implementing this allows you to take advantage of instructions with a payload.

### Layer 3: Control

The control layer applies the configuration properties that are part of every instruction. These properties, like 
sleep time, are meant to trigger specific actions on the agent. These properties are configured dynamically from 
the server's agent modal on the GUI and are picked up by an agent upon each beacon. 

## Additional concepts

As the layers are being developed, the author should consider a few important details:

* Delivery: How do you plan on starting this agent?
* Detection: How easy is this agent to detect? Should you build in protections? What about persistence mechanisms?

## Building an active agent

Start by getting a feel for the HTTP(S) agent endpoints, which are located in the rest_api.py module.
```
POST  /ping 
POST  /instructions
*     /file/download
POST  /file/upload
```

Keep in mind, you can create new endpoint addresses by simply copy/pasting the endpoint definitions with new addresses. 
For example, if you were concerned that the /ping address could be detected, you could add the following line to
the rest_api.py:*enable* function:
```
self.app_svc.application.router.add_route('POST', '/you/cannot/find/me', self._ping)
```

### Layer 1

Start by writing a POST request to the /beacon endpoint. 

In your agent code, create a flat JSON dictionary of key/value pairs and ensure the following properties are included
as keys. Add values which correlate to the host your agent will be running on. Note- all of these properties are
optional - but you should aim to cover as many as possible to get the full functionality of the server.

| Key           | Value  | Notes |
| :------------- |:------------- |:-------------|  
| server        | The location (IP or FQDN) of the C2 server    | |
| platform      | The operating system | The platform is evaluated against the platform field of each ability. Currently you can use windows, darwin or linux |
| group         | A group name you want to associate to this agent  | |
| host          | The hostname of the machine | |
| username      | The username running the agent | |
| architecture  | The architecture of the host. | |
| executors     | A comma-separated string of executors allowed on the host | Executors are evaluated against the executor block of each ability. Currently, you can use sh, cmd, psh and pwsh |
| privilege     | The privilege level of the agent process, either User or Elevated | Privilege is evaluated against the optional privilege block of each ability file |
| c2            | The C2-communication name | The c2 determines how to send instructions back to the agent. You should use "http" |
| pid           | The process identifier of the agent | |
| location      | The location of the agent on disk | |
| exe_name      | The name of the agent binary file | |

At this point, you're ready to make a POST request with the profile to the /instructions endpoint. You should get back
1) The recommended number of seconds to sleep before sending the next beacon
2) The recommended number of minutes to wait before killing the agent, once the server is unreachable (0 means infinite)
3) list of instructions - base64 encoded - which will be empty.
```
profile=$(echo '{"server":"http://127.0.0.1:8888","platform":"darwin"}' | base64)
curl -s -X POST -d $profile localhost:8888/beacon | base64 --decode
...{"paw": "dcoify", sleep": 59, "watchdog": 0, "instructions": "[]"}
```

> Note the paw property returned back from the server. This represents a unique identifier for your new agent. Each
time you call the /beacon endpoint without this paw, a new agent will be created on the server - so you should ensure
that future beacons include it.

You can now navigate to the CALDERA UI, click into the agents tab and view your new agent. At this point, the agent
is fully ready to run operations. There are 2 more layers required to unlock the full potential of an operation - but
you can now run any ability that doesn't use a payload.
