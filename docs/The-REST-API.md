The REST API
============

All REST API functionality can be viewed in the rest_api.py module in the source code.

### /api/rest

You can interact with all parts of CALDERA through the core REST API endpoint /api/rest. If you
send requests to "localhost" - you are not required to pass a key header. If you send requests to
127.0.0.1 or any other IP addresses, the key header is required. You can set the API key in the 
conf/default.yml file. Some examples below will use the header, others will not, for example.

> Any request to this endpoint must include an "index" as part of the request, which routes it to the appropriate object type. 

Here are the available REST API functions:

## Agents

#### DELETE

Delete any agent. 
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8888/api/rest -d '{"index":"agents","paw":"$agent_paw"}'
```

## Operations

#### DELETE

Delete any operation.
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8888/api/rest -d '{"index":"operations","id":"$operation_id"}'
```

#### POST

Change the state of any operation. In addition to finished, you can also use: paused, run_one_link or running.
```bash
curl -X POST -H "KEY:ADMIN123" http://localhost:8888/api/rest -d '{"index":"operation", "op_id":123, "state":"finished"}'
```

#### PUT

Create a new operation. All that is required is the operation name, similar to creating a new operation
in the browser.
```bash
curl -X PUT -H "KEY:$KEY" http://127.0.0.1:8888/api/rest -d '{"index":"operations","name":"testoperation1"}'
```
Optionally, you can include:

1) group (defaults to empty string)
2) adversary_id (defaults to empty string)
3) planner (defaults to *sequential*)
4) source (defaults to *basic*')
5) jitter (defaults to *2/8*)
6) obfuscator (defaults to *plain-text*)
7) visibility (defaults to *50*)
8) autonomous (defaults to *1*)
9) phases_enabled (defaults to *1*)
10) auto_close (defaults to *0*)

To learn more about these options, read the "What is an operation?" documentation section.           

## /file/upload

Files can be uploaded to CALDERA by POST'ing a file to the /file/upload endpoint. Uploaded files will be put in the exfil_dir location specified in the default.yml file.

#### Example
```bash
curl -F 'data=@path/to/file' http://localhost:8888/file/upload
```

## /file/download

Files can be dowloaded from CALDERA through the /file/download endpoint. This endpoint requires an HTTP header called "file" with the file name as the value. When a file is requested, CALDERA will look inside each of the payload directories listed in the local.yml file until it finds a file matching the name.

Files can also be downloaded indirectly through the [payload block of an ability](What-is-an-ability.md).

> Additionally, the [54ndc47 plugin](Plugins-sandcat.md) delivery commands utilize the file download endpoint to drop the agent on a host

#### Example
```bash
curl -X POST -H "file:wifi.sh" http://localhost:8888/file/download > wifi.sh
```
