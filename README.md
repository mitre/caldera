# CALDERA

*Full documentation, training and use-cases can be found [here](https://caldera.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).*

CALDERA is a cyber security framework designed to easily run autonomous breach-and-simulation exercises. It can also be used to run manual red-team engagements or automated incident response.

It is built on the [MITRE ATT&CKâ„¢ framework](https://attack.mitre.org/) and is an active research project at MITRE.

The framework consists of two components:

1) **The core system**. This is the framework code, consisting of what is available in this repository. Included is 
an asynchronous command-and-control (C2) server with a REST API and a web interface. 
2) **Plugins**. These are separate repositories that hang off of the core framework, providing additional functionality. 
Examples include agents, GUI interfaces, collections of TTPs and more. 

## Plugins

- **[Access](https://github.com/mitre/access)** (red team initial access tools and techniques)
- **[Atomic](https://github.com/mitre/atomic)** (Atomic Read Team project TTPs)
- **[Builder](https://github.com/mitre/builder)** (dynamically compile payloads)
- **[Compass](https://github.com/mitre/compass)** (ATT&CK visualizations)
- **[GameBoard](https://github.com/mitre/gameboard)** (visualize joint red and blue operations)
- **[Human](https://github.com/mitre/human)** (create simulated noise on an endpoint)
- **[Manx](https://github.com/mitre/manx)** (shell functionality and reverse shell payloads)
- **[Mock](https://github.com/mitre/mock)** (simulate agents in operations)
- **[Response](https://github.com/mitre/response)** (incident response)
- **[Sandcat](https://github.com/mitre/sandcat)** (default agent)
- **[SSL](https://github.com/mitre/SSL)** (enable https for caldera)
- **[Stockpile](https://github.com/mitre/stockpile)** (technique and profile storehouse)
- **[Training](https://github.com/mitre/training)** (certification and training course)

## Requirements

These requirements are for the computer running the core framework:

* Any Linux or MacOS
* Python 3.6.1+ (with Pip3)
* Google Chrome is our only supported browser
* Recommended hardware to run on is 8GB+ RAM and 2+ CPUs

## Installation

Start by cloning this repository recursively, passing the desired version/release in x.x.x format. This will pull in all available plugins. If you clone master - or any non-release branch - you may experience bugs.
```Bash
git clone https://github.com/mitre/caldera.git --recursive --branch x.x.x 
```

Next, install the PIP requirements:
```Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
> Want to super-power your CALDERA server installation? Make sure GoLang (1.13+) is installed.

Finally, start the server. 
```Bash
python server.py --insecure
```

Once started, you should log into http://localhost:8888 using the credentials red/admin. Then go into Plugins -> Training and complete the capture-the-flag style training course to learn how to use the framework.

## Video tutorial

Watch the [following video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mVGjqu03fg) for a brief run through of how to run your first operation.
