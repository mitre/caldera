# CALDERA&trade;

*Full documentation, training and use-cases can be found [here](https://caldera.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).*

CALDERA&trade; is a cyber security platform designed to easily automate adversary emulation, assist manual red-teams, and automate incident response.

It is built on the [MITRE ATT&CKâ„¢ framework](https://attack.mitre.org/) and is an active research project at MITRE.

The framework consists of two components:

1) **The core system**. This is the framework code, consisting of what is available in this repository. Included is
an asynchronous command-and-control (C2) server with a REST API and a web interface.
2) **Plugins**. These repositories expand the core framework capabilities and providing additional functionality. Examples include agents, reporting, collections of TTPs and more.

## Plugins

- **[SAML](https://github.com/mitre/saml)** (SAML authentication)

## Requirements

These requirements are for the computer running the core framework:

* Any Linux or MacOS
* Python 3.7+ (with Pip3)
* Recommended hardware to run on is 8GB+ RAM and 2+ CPUs
* Recommended: GoLang 1.17+ to dynamically compile GoLang-based agents.

## Installation

Concise installation steps:
```Bash
git clone https://github.com/mitre/caldera.git --recursive
cd caldera
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 server.py --insecure
```

Full steps:
Start by cloning this repository recursively, passing the desired version/release in x.x.x format. This will pull in all available plugins.
```Bash
git clone https://github.com/mitre/caldera.git --recursive --branch x.x.x
```

Next, install the PIP requirements:
```Bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
**Super-power your CALDERA server installation! [Install GoLang (1.17+)](https://go.dev/doc/install)**

Finally, start the server.
```Bash
python3 server.py --insecure
```

Once started, log into http://localhost:8888 using the default credentials red/admin. Then go into Plugins -> Training and complete the capture-the-flag style training course to learn how to use CALDERA.

## Docker Deployment
To build a CALDERA docker image, ensure you have docker installed and perform the following actions:
```Bash
# Recursively clone the CALDERA repository if you have not done so
git clone https://github.com/mitre/caldera.git --recursive

# Build the docker image. Change image tagging as desired.
# WIN_BUILD is set to true to allow CALDERA installation to compile windows-based agents.
# Alternatively, you can use the docker compose YML file via "docker-compose build"
cd caldera
docker build . --build-arg WIN_BUILD=true -t caldera:latest

# Run the image. Change port forwarding configuration as desired.
docker run -p 8888:8888 caldera:latest
```

To gracefully terminate your docker container, do the following:
```Bash
# Find the container ID for your docker container running CALDERA
docker ps

# Send interrupt signal, e.g. "docker kill --signal=SIGINT 5b9220dd9c0f"
docker kill --signal=SIGINT [container ID]
```

## Licensing

In addition to CALDERA&trade;'s open source capabilities, MITRE maintains several in-house CALDERA&trade; plugins that offer
more advanced functionality. For more information, or to discuss licensing opportunities, please reach out to
